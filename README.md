I created this repo for multiple reasons:
- Have a sample project that anyone can use as a starting point
- Practice and consolidate the clean architecture concepts (and other principles stated below)
- Have an example project with standard terminology to make teaching easier
- Fun

## Principles
- Clean architecture
    - Separation of config from app
    - Dealing with exceptions
- Testing
    - TDD
    - Given, When, Then
    - Evident data
    - Table driven testing
- Package by feature
- Use cases
    - DTOs
    - Command / query
- Handlers
    - REST maturity level
