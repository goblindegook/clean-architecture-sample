I created this rpo for multiple reasons:
- Have a sample project that anyone can use as a starting point
- Practice and consolidate the clean architecture concepts (and other principles stated below)
- Have an example project with standard terminology to make teaching easier
- Fun

## Principles
- Top-down approach
- Clean architecture
  - Separation of config from app
  - Dealing with exceptions
- Package by feature
- Command / query
- Testing
  - TDD
  - Given, When, Then
  - Evident data
- REST maturity level
- DTOs
